    description:
        "This project aims to develop a real-time chat application enhanced with AI capabilities. The application will allow users to communicate with each other through text messages and will incorporate AI features such as sentiment analysis of messages, automated topic summarization of conversations, and AI-powered smart replies/suggestions to facilitate faster and more engaging communication. The system will also include user authentication, message persistence, and scalability features.",
